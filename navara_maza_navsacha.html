        <h4>
            <i>Navra Maza Navsacha</i> is a 2004 Marathi comedy film directed by Sachin Pilgaonkar. It is a hilarious
            and heartwarming journey following a couple, Vacky and his wife, as they embark on a mission to fulfill an
            old vow made by Vacky's mother at the Ganpatipule temple.
            <br><br>
            What begins as a simple pilgrimage turns into a rollercoaster of comedy, adventure, and confusion. A
            mannequin is humorously used to dodge a vow of traveling naked, leading to a series of unexpected turns â€”
            including a hidden diamond smuggling operation and the notorious villain Babu Kaalia.
            <br><br>
            The film reaches its climax at the temple, where Vacky is forced to fulfill the vow in the most unexpected
            way. With clever humor and heartfelt moments, the movie delivers a happy ending as the couple is rewarded,
            making it a must-watch for fans of Marathi comedy.
