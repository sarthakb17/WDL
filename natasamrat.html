        <h4>
            <i>Natsamrat</i> is a powerful Marathi drama that tells the story of Ganpat Ramchandra Belwalkar (Appa), a
            legendary theatre actor who gives up his fame and fortune for a peaceful retirement. However, his outspoken
            nature and emotional intensity lead to strained relationships with his family.
            <br><br>
            After gifting his property to his children, Appa is emotionally neglected and humiliated. He and his wife
            Kaveri move from house to house, facing rejection and heartbreak. The film captures Appaâ€™s emotional journey
            as he reflects on his past, grieves for his loved ones, and ultimately embraces his identity as an artist to
            the very end.
            <br><br>
            *Natsamrat* explores the depth of love, loss, dignity, and the sacrifices made by an artist. Nana Patekar's
            commanding performance brings gravitas and poignancy to the character, making this one of the most acclaimed
            films in Marathi cinema.
