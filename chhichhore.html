        <p><strong></strong> Chhichhore (transl.â€‰Frivolous) is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama
            film.Set parallelly in the 1990s and 2019, Chhichhore tells the story of Aniruddh "Anni" Pathak, a
            middle-aged divorced man whose son Raghav tries to commit suicide after failing to clear the JEE entrance
            examination, and who, despite survival, is unwilling to live due to the fear of being branded as a "loser",
            which makes a desperate Anni recount his own experience to Raghav of his own time at college, wherein he and
            his five friends too were called 'losers', and how they managed to remove that 'tag'; as he continues along
            to narrate his story, the other five join their friend and complete the story. </p>

        <p>Chhichhore is inspired by writer-director Nitesh Tiwari's own experiences of college life as a metallurgical
            engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, his alma-mater, which is depicted in the
            film as the 'National College of Technology'; although not completely biographical in nature, it features
            character sketches loosely inspired by Tiwari himself as protagonist Aniruddha Pathak, as well as some of
            his closest friends and seniors. Some of the scenes were incorporated from the lives of co-writers Piyush
            Gupta and Nikhil Mehrotra, who worked under Tiwari at Leo Burnett.</p>
