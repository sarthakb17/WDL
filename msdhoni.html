        <h4>
            *M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story* is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language biographical sports drama directed by Neeraj
            Pandey. The film is based on the life of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former captain of the Indian national cricket
            team. Sushant Singh Rajput stars as Dhoni, with supporting roles played by Disha Patani, Kiara Advani,
            Anupam Kher, and Bhumika Chawla.
            <br><br>
            The movie follows Dhoni’s journey from his humble beginnings in Ranchi to his rise as one of India’s most
            celebrated cricket captains. It highlights his personal and professional struggles, his love life, and key
            turning points in his cricketing career.
            <br><br>
            The idea for the film was suggested by Dhoni’s manager Arun Pandey after an incident post the 2011 Cricket
            World Cup. Neeraj Pandey took on the project, researching Dhoni’s life and eventually involving Dhoni as a
            consultant. The film was both critically acclaimed and a commercial hit, with praise for Sushant’s
            performance and the film’s inspirational story.
