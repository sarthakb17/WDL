            Set in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains part of
            his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of
            Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Company of the Ring) begin
            their perilous journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.
            <br><br>

            million worldwide in its original run and received 13 Academy Award nominations, winning 4 including Best
