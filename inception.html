            Inception is a 2010 science fiction action heist film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also
            produced it with Emma Thomas, his wife. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals
            information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal
            history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. The
            ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page, Tom Hardy,
            Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Dileep Rao, and Michael Caine.

            After the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment for a
            horror film envisioning "dream stealers," based on lucid dreaming. Deciding he needed more experience before
            tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on
            2005's Batman Begins, 2006's The Prestige, and 2008's The Dark Knight. The treatment was revised over six
            months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009. Inception was filmed in six countries, beginning in
            Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22. Its official budget was $160 million, split between
            Warner Bros. and Legendary. Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film's
            US$100 million in advertising expenditure.
            <br><br>
            Inception's premiere was held in London on July 8, 2010; it was released in both conventional and IMAX
            theaters beginning on July 16, 2010. Inception grossed over $837 million worldwide, becoming the
            fourth-highest-grossing film of 2010. Considered one of the best films of the 2010s, Inception, among its
            numerous accolades, won four Oscars (Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual
            Effects) and was nominated for four more (Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best
            Original Score) at the 83rd Academy Awards.
