            Kingsman: The Secret Service is a 2014 spy action comedy film directed by Matthew Vaughn. It is the first in
            the Kingsman film series and is based on the comic book series of the same name, written by Mark Millar and
            Dave Gibbons, published by Millarworld.
            <br><br>
            The movie premiered at the Butt-Numb-A-Thon festival on 13 December 2014, and was theatrically released in
            the United Kingdom on 29 January 2015 and in the United States on 13 February 2015 by 20th Century Fox.
            <br><br>
            The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its stylized action sequences,
            direction, performances, antagonist, visual flair, music score, and dark humour. It grossed over $414
            million worldwide, becoming Vaughnâ€™s most commercially successful film at that time. In 2015, the film won
            the Empire Award for Best British Film.
