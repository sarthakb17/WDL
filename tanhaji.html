            <i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i> is a 2020 Indian Hindi-language epic historical action film directed by
            Om Raut and produced by Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, and Ajay Devgn under T-Series Films and Ajay Devgn
            FFilms. The movie stars Ajay Devgn in the titular role as Tanaji Malusare, alongside Kajol and Saif Ali
            Khan.
            <br><br>
            The film is set in the 17th century and follows Tanaji’s mission to reclaim the Kondhana fortress from
            Mughal forces led by the ruthless Udaybhan Singh Rathore, played by Saif Ali Khan. With themes of valor,
            sacrifice, and patriotism, the film showcases Tanaji’s bravery and strategic brilliance.
            <br><br>
            Tanhaji was initially titled *Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior*, but was later renamed. It was launched in July
            2017 and marked Om Raut’s Bollywood debut. The film was shot primarily in Film City, Mumbai, with a few
            scenes filmed in Pune. It features music by Ajay–Atul, Sachet–Parampara, and Mehul Vyas, with a background
            score by Sandeep Shirodkar.
            <br><br>
            Tanhaji was a massive box office success and received critical acclaim for its visual effects, direction,
            performances, and historical storytelling.
