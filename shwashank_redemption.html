            <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> is a 1994 American prison drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont.
            It is based on the 1982 Stephen King novella <i>Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption</i>. The movie stars
            Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover,
            despite his claims of innocence.
            <br><br>
            Inside Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy befriends Ellis "Red" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman), a
            longtime inmate and contraband smuggler. Over the years, Andy earns the respect of the other inmates and the
            prison staff and plays a crucial role in the warden's money-laundering operation.
            <br><br>
            Filming began in 1993 in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the primary location.
            The film's powerful themes of hope, friendship, and resilience, combined with outstanding performances and
            Thomas Newman's iconic score, have helped it become a timeless classic. Today, it remains one of the
            highest-rated films of all time.
