        <h4>
            <i>Vaalvi</i> is a 2023 Indian Marathi-language dark comedy thriller directed by Paresh Mokashi. The film
            follows Aniket, a man trapped in a loveless marriage with Avani, who conspires with his girlfriend Devika to
            stage a murder that looks like a suicide.
            <br><br>
            However, their plan begins to unravel in unpredictable ways when Avani’s body and suicide note go missing.
            Avani's psychiatrist and secret lover, Dr. Anshuman, confesses to murdering her to protect his own secrets,
            setting off a series of darkly comic and chaotic events.
            <br><br>
            As the trio scrambles to cover up their crimes, more bodies pile up, including a woman and a police
            inspector. In a final twist of irony, all of them are killed by a falling chandelier while attempting to
            hide the evidence — ending the film with a poetic justice symbolized by termites chewing through a rope.
