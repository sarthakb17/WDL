        <h4>
            The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is the first
            installment in the Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo
            Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside
            the Matrix, a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. Believing computer hacker Neo to be "the
            One" prophesied to defeat them, Morpheus recruits him into a rebellion against the machines.
            <br><br>
            The film's success led to two sequels by the Wachowskis, both released in 2003 â€” *The Matrix Reloaded* and
            *The Matrix Revolutions*. The franchise expanded with comic books, video games, and *The Animatrix*, an
            animated anthology. A fourth film, *The Matrix Resurrections*, directed by Lana Wachowski, was released in
            2021. The series is praised for its groundbreaking visual effects, action choreography, and deep
            philosophical themes.
