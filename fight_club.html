        <h4>
            Fight Club is a 1999 American film directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and
            Helena Bonham Carter. It is based on the 1996 novel *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the
            unnamed
            narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a "fight club" with a soap salesman, Tyler
            Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled with an impoverished but beguiling woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).
            <br><br>
            The unnamed Narrator, who struggles with insomnia and dissatisfaction with his job and lifestyle, finds
            temporary solace in support groups. As his insomnia worsens, he discovers that expressions of emotional
            vulnerability help him sleep, leading him to join multiple groups for people facing emotionally distressing
            problems, despite his expressions being fraudulent. His efforts are thwarted when Marla Singer, another
            impostor, joins the same groups. The Narrator cannot present his fabricated struggles as genuine, or divert
            his attention from her presence as an impostor, causing his sleeplessness to return. He arranges for them to
            attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange
            contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees.
