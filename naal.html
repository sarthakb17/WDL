        <h4>
            <i>Naal</i> is a heartfelt 2018 Marathi film directed by Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti. It follows the emotional journey of Chaitanya, an eight-year-old boy living in a quiet village with his loving family.
            <br><br>
            One day, Chaitanya learns from his uncle that his mother may not be his biological one. This revelation unsettles him and creates emotional turmoil as he tries to test her love and loyalty. Events unfold as he meets the woman he believes to be his real mother, Parvati, and struggles with confusion and guilt.
            <br><br>
            Through loss, realization, and growing maturity, Chaitanya eventually comes to understand the true essence of motherhood. He recognizes that the woman who raised him — with care, compassion, and discipline — is indeed his real “Aai” in every meaningful sense.
            <br><br>
            With touching performances and themes of identity, love, and belonging, *Naal* captures the innocence of childhood and the depth of family bonds.
