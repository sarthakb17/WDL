            3 Idiots follows three engineering students, Rancho, Farhan, and Raju, at the prestigious Imperial College
            of Engineering. Rancho challenges the strict, rote-learning system, clashing with the college director, Dr. Virus.
            After a classmate, Joy, commits suicide due to academic pressure, Rancho exposes the flaws in the system.
            Rancho helps Farhan pursue photography and supports Raju through family struggles. The trio prank Chatur, a
            competitive student, and make a bet with him about success. Raju attempts suicide but survives, leading to
            his recovery and eventual success. The trio is expelled after stealing an exam paper, but they’re later
            forgiven after saving Virus’s daughter during childbirth. Years later, they discover the real Rancho is
            Phunsukh Wangdu, a famous inventor. Rancho’s true identity inspires his friends to follow their dreams.
