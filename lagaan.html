        <p><strong></strong> Set in 1893, during the late Victorian period of British colonial rule in India, the film
            follows the inhabitants of a village in Central India, who, burdened by high taxes and several years of
            drought, are challenged by an arrogant British Indian Army officer to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid
            paying the taxes they owe. The villagers face the arduous task of learning a game that is alien to them and
            playing for a victory.</p>

        <p>The film initially grossed ₹65.97 crore (equivalent to ₹263 crore or US$31 million in 2023) worldwide in
            2001. This made it the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001, behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... and
            Gadar: Ek Prem Katha.[59]

            Domestically, Lagaan grossed ₹55.13 crore (equivalent to ₹219 crore or US$26 million in 2023) in India. Its
            domestic net income was ₹34.31 crore, equivalent to ₹187 crore ($25 million) when adjusted for
            inflation.[60]

            With an overseas gross of ₹10.84 crore[42] (US$2.2 million) in 2001, it was the year's second
            highest-grossing Indian film overseas, preceded only by Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham....[61] Lagaan's overseas
            gross included £600,000 in the United Kingdom, US$910,000 in the United States and Canada, and US$180,000 in
            the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[60]</p>
