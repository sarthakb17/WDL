        <p><strong></strong>Mission Majnu is a 2023 Indian Hindi-language spy action thriller film directed by
            Shantanu Bagchi and produced by Ronnie Screwvala.The film faced multiple delays, first being scheduled for
            theatrical release on 13 May 2022 and then on 10 June the same year before being indefinitely delayed.
            Ultimately, the film's theatrical release was cancelled and it was released directly on Netflix on 20
            January 2023 to mixed reviews from critics and audiences </p>

        <p>Bollywood Hungama rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and termed the film as a "gripping saga" with a tight
            script, intelligent scenes, taut execution, and a memorable performance." Tushar Joshi for India Today
            rated 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Sidharth is good in scenes where he is battling the stigma and pain of
            his past yet wants to move ahead and show his loyalty to his country and team. Rashmika Mandanna doesn’t
            have much to do apart from trying to strike up some chemistry with Sid." Dhaval Roy of The Times of
            India rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote that the film is "gripping in parts, but it’s too convenient,
            which takes away from the narrative. While great, the action stretches in places and makes the movie seem
            formulaic". Dishya Sharma of News 18 rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote "Mission Majnu robs you
            of the thrills of a spy film. Watch it to see Sidharth and Rashmika in a different avatars".</p>
